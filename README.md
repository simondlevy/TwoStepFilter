This repository contains the LaTex source code, makefile, and image files for building the PDF of my translation of 
[A Two-step Kalman/Complementary Filter for Estimation of Vertical Position Using an IMU-Barometer System](http://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=HSSHBT_2016_v25n3_202).  If you don't want to build the PDF
yourself, you can get a copy
[here](https://home.wlu.edu/~levys/TwoStepFilter.pdf).  Not knowing Korean, I
used GoogleTranslate to convert the document from Korean to English.  I welcome any corrections to any mistakes that
you see in my translation.
