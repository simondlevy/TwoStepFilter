This repository contains the LaTex source code, makefile, and image files for
building the PDF of my translation of [A Two-step Kalman/Complementary Filter
for Estimation of Vertical Position Using an IMU-Barometer
System](http://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=HSSHBT_2016_v25n3_202) by Jung Keun Lee.
If you don't want to build the PDF yourself, you can get a copy
[here](https://simondlevy.academic.wlu.edu/files/2022/11/TwoStepFilter.pdf).  Not knowing Korean, I
used GoogleTranslate to convert the document from Korean to English.  So I welcome
corrections to any mistakes that you see in my translation.
